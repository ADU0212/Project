## 🌐 About the Project

In real-world scenarios, storing files on just one cloud provider can lead to loss if that service fails. This project explores the architecture and potential of a **multi-cloud file backup system**, where every uploaded file is stored redundantly across different clouds.

Although the current version is **not fully functional**, it lays the foundation for:
- Frontend interface for uploading files
- Backend logic to trigger uploads to multiple clouds
- Basic configuration files for AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob

## 🔧 Planned Features

- [ ] Upload files through a simple web interface
- [ ] Automatically back them up to:
  - ✅ Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
  - ✅ Amazon S3
  - ✅ Azure Blob Storage
- [ ] Keep a log of each upload and its cloud locations
- [ ] View file status and backup history

## ⚠️ Project Status

> **Disclaimer:**  
> The current version is **not yet functional**. This repository serves as a blueprint or starter project for building and testing a real-world multi-cloud backup solution.

You can extend this by adding:
- Serverless functions (like Cloud Functions, AWS Lambda)
- Auth systems (Google Sign-In, Firebase Auth, etc.)
- Real-time file status tracking

## 🧪 Tools & Technologies (Intended)

- HTML / JavaScript (frontend)
- Node.js (backend - planned)
- AWS SDK
- Google Cloud SDK
- Azure Blob SDK
- GitHub (version control)

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned:
- The benefits and limitations of multi-cloud storage
- Basics of cloud SDK setup for file upload
- How to plan and structure cloud-based applications
- Importance of redundancy in data storage
